So you want to help out with development?  **That's Fantastic**.  Here is how you can get started:

## Overview of the process

1. [Initial Setup](#initial-setup).
2. Create a branch for your work.(make is short)
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes with a good [Commit Message](#commit-message).
5. Push your branch to your fork on Github.
6. [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request-on-github) so we can review, discuss, and merge your changes.

### Initial Setup

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. Fork the repository in GitHub with the 'Fork' button.

### Commit Message

Some good rules for commit messages are
 
 * start with the issue number if it exists
 * the first line is commit summary, 50 characters or less,
 * followed by an empty line
 * followed by a longer explanation of the commit if necessary

The first line of a commit message becomes the **title** of a pull
request on GitHub, like the subject line of an email.  Including
the key info in the first line will help us respond faster to
your pull.

### Create a Pull Request on Github

Go to *your* GitHub repository at
https://github.com/my-github-username/ucsf_identity_web_banner_templates,
switch branch to your topic branch and click the 'Pull Request' button.
You can then add further comments to your pull request.
